# Ren-Py-Playthroughs-Save-System

The aim is to create the system in such a way that it can be safely dropped into any other project/distribution

The current state of the project is: Working - not yet optimised for Best Practice, and may still contain bugs

There are a few custom images in the /gui folder, and some saves for demonstration purposes in the /saves folder
Those saves will not show up until you create Playthroughs with the relevant names:

However, you are warned that - in it's current state - it may not behave itself;
I do not yet consider it fit for purpose.
