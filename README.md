# Ren-Py-Playthroughs-Save-System

## [ INTRODUCTION ]
- This package overrides the 'fileslots(title)' screen, defining classes, functions, transitions and styling to support augmented functionality
- The primary purpose is to provide an alternative, playthrough-style save/load system, whilst retaining access to the original system and files

---

The aim is to create the system in such a way that it can be safely dropped into any other project/distribution

The current state of the project is: Working - not yet optimised for Best Practice, and may still contain bugs

---

There are a few custom images in the /gui folder, and some saves for demonstration purposes in the /saves folder

Those saves will not show up until you create Playthroughs with the relevant names:
