# Ren-Py-Playthroughs-Save-System

## [ INTRODUCTION ]
- This package overrides the 'fileslots(title)' screen, defining classes, functions, transitions and styling to support augmented functionality
- The primary purpose is to provide an alternative, playthrough-style save/load system, whilst retaining access to the original system and files
- The secondary purpose is to explain less familiar concepts and techniques to a third-party (e.g. regular expressions, lambdas, hijacking a transition to run a function, etc.)
- **WARNING**: I have almost no training for coding, and hadn't written any python/Ren'Py code until four months ago. If I've been dumb anywhere, I apologize :D
- **WARNING**: Some of the commentary is purely notes to myself or a specific third party. If I offend anyone with anything I've inadvertently left in here, I apologize :(
- **WARNING**: I know nothing about coding for MacOs, linux, Android etc. Thus third-party expertise will likely be required to ensure compatibility

The aim is to create the system in such a way that it can be safely dropped into any other project/distribution

The current state of the project is: Working - not yet optimised for Best Practice, and may still contain bugs

---

There are a few custom images in the /gui folder, and some saves for demonstration purposes in the /saves folder

Those saves will not show up until you create Playthroughs with the relevant names:

However, you are warned that - in it's current state - it may not behave itself;
I do not yet consider it fit for purpose.
