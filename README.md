# Ren-Py-Playthroughs-Save-System

## [ INTRODUCTION ]
- This package overrides the 'fileslots(title)' screen, defining classes, functions, transitions and styling to support augmented functionality
- The primary purpose is to provide an alternative, playthrough-style save/load system, whilst retaining access to the original system and files

---

The aim is to create the system in such a way that it can be safely dropped into any other project/distribution

The current state of the project is: Working - not yet optimised for Best Practice, and may still contain bugs

---

License: This code is free to use.

However, you are warned that - in it's current state - it may not behave itself;
I do not yet consider it fit for purpose.
